# Securities-Correlation
This project tracks rolling correlations between asset classes and flags statistically significant deviations from historical norms using z-score analysis. When correlations break from expected patterns, such as the classic equity-bond hedge relationship deteriorating, it creates actionable trading opportunities through mean reversion or signals regime changes in market structure.
